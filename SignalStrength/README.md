# <img src="SignalStrength-icon.svg" height=80px> Signal Strength
Measure the signal strength of your router around the house with this Signal Strength Meter. Once the WiFi is configured by joining the "Home Network Study" network and setting the credentials via the captive portal, the analogue meter will reflect the signal strength (RSSI) of the router at that location.

The circuit shows an Adafruit HUZZAH32, but the code will compile for any ESP8266 or ESP32 (pin assignments will need to change of course).

## Software
### Arduino
The Arduino core for the ESP8266 or ESP32 must be installed:
* ESP8266 - https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino#installing-with-boards-manager
* ESP32 - https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md

And following Arduino libraries are required:
* Approximate - https://github.com/davidchatting/Approximate/
* YoYoWiFiManager - https://github.com/interactionresearchstudio/YoYoWiFiManager
* ListLib - https://github.com/luisllamasbinaburo/Arduino-List
