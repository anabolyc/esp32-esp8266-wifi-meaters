# <img src="DeviceWheel-icon.svg" height=80px> Device Wheel
Watch an individual device's use of the network with this Device Wheel. Once the WiFi is configured by joining the "Home Network Study" network and setting the credentials via the captive portal, bringing an IoT device in proximity of the Device Wheel will cause it to pair and the wheel will spin whenever the is network activity - clockwise for downloads, anti-clockwise for uploads.

The circuit shows an Adafruit HUZZAH32, but the code will compile for any ESP8266 or ESP32 (pin assignments will need to change of course).

## Software
### Arduino
The Arduino core for the ESP8266 or ESP32 must be installed:
* ESP8266 - https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino#installing-with-boards-manager
* ESP32 - https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md

And following Arduino libraries are required:
* Approximate - https://github.com/davidchatting/Approximate/
* YoYoWiFiManager - https://github.com/interactionresearchstudio/YoYoWiFiManager
* ListLib - https://github.com/luisllamasbinaburo/Arduino-List
