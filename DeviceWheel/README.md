# <img src="DeviceWheel-icon.svg" height=80px> Device Wheel
Watch an individual device's use of the network with this Device Wheel. Once the WiFi is configured by joining the "Home Network Study" network and setting the credentials via the captive portal, bringing an IoT device in proximity of the Device Wheel will cause it to pair and the wheel will spin whenever the is network activity - clockwise for downloads, anti-clockwise for uploads.

The circuit shows an Adafruit HUZZAH32, but the code will compile for any ESP8266 or ESP32 (pin assignments will need to change of course).

## Software
### Arduino
The Arduino core for the ESP8266 or ESP32 must be installed for the Arduino IDE:
* ESP8266 - https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino#installing-with-boards-manager
* ESP32 - https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md

And the Sketch Data Folder Uploader Tool:
* ESP8266 - https://randomnerdtutorials.com/install-esp8266-filesystem-uploader-arduino-ide/
* ESP32 - https://randomnerdtutorials.com/install-esp32-filesystem-uploader-arduino-ide/

And following Arduino libraries are required:
* Approximate - https://github.com/davidchatting/Approximate/
* YoYoWiFiManager - https://github.com/interactionresearchstudio/YoYoWiFiManager
* ListLib - https://github.com/luisllamasbinaburo/Arduino-List

From the *Tools* menu then select either `Generic ESP822 Module` or `ESP32 Dev Module` and then for the ESP8266 select `4MB (FS:3MB OTA:~512KB)` for *Flash Size* and for the ESP32 select a *Partition Scheme* of `Default 4MB with spiffs (1.2MB APP/1.5MB SPIFFS)` - assuming a *Flash Size* of 4MB. Then upload the associated `data` folder using the uploader tool - also found under the *Tools* menu. The data folder contains the HTML, JavaScript and image files for the captive portal that configures the WiFi. If you don't upload the data folder the portal will say, *Yo Yo Machines default HTML*.

## WiFi Set-up
The WiFi is configured by joining the *Home Network Study* network with the password *blinkblink* and entering the details of your network. If multiple meters are started once they will automaically discover each other and the set-up will shared between them. This is enabled by the [YoYoWiFiManager](https://github.com/interactionresearchstudio/YoYoWiFiManager).
