# Three WiFi Meters
The Three WiFi Meters are three ways of experiencing WiFi networks, each attempts to disclose properties of this near ubiquitous technology. They are built for the [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) or [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32) using the [Approximate](https://github.com/davidchatting/Approximate) and [YoYoWiFiManager](https://github.com/interactionresearchstudio/YoYoWiFiManager) Arduino libraries.

The meters works with 2.4GHz WiFi networks, but not 5GHz networks - as neither ESP8266 or ESP32 support this technology.
